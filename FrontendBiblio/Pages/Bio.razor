<MudText Class="mb-8">How do I see myself In 20 years?</MudText>
<MudAlert Severity="Severity.Normal">

For me this question is very hard. There are so many possibilities that I would like to pursue that giving a simple and straight forward answer sounds like something a very different person from me would do. In this period time I just hope to find myself. Right now I consider myself to be in a journey with erratic paths that do not look well established and that change at every second, one of my hopes is that in 20 years I will be walking through a steady and tranquil path filled with achievement, confidence and happiness. I hope to have found a real passion something that evolves me and all of my characteristics and utilizes them to the fullest extent, in this moment in my life I'm undecided about this, there are so many things that catch my attention that I just don-t know in which one I should focus all of myself into. In 20 years I hope to have found real, unconditional love. Now I know that talking about love in this day and age sounds silly and sometime corny but I don't care, even though this type of love sounds like something out of a fairytale to some but I am a dreamer and I love songs about impossibilities being conquered. I hope to have someone by my side who understands me at my core, at my lowest and at my highest. A guide, a counselor and a lover.
In 20 years I hope to have achieved something that makes me proud. With that I'm talking about an achievement that creates happiness. Throughout the years and because of the influence of a lot of situations I have lived and people I have encountered myself with I just wish to make something that makes happiness. There is so much pain  and suffering in the world and I just wish to be one of the chosen or one of the people enlightened enough to bring an ailment to this. In my opinion everyone right now is so individual and so self centered that we have lost almost all of our sense of community and that makes everyone sad and unfulfilled, we are social beings by nature so this type of mentality just takes us out of our element. I wish to be one of those that can send this message into the world in one way or another. 
In 20 years I hope to have calmness and wisdom. Right now everything seems to be moving so fast that I-m not able to see clearly, everything is riddled in an indecision fog so my decisions are not so guided and sometimes can be mistaken and can cause me pain. In 20 years I hope to have developed wisdom and intuition so I can see clearly through everything, through the nonsense and the silly obstacles I can sometime put onto myself. 
In 20 years I wish to have lived a full life, now I know that this may sound crazy but it is truly what I want. I am not a person that just sits still and watches the world go by themselves, I wish to live, to experience, to get myself out of my comfort zone and that is why I say that. to have lived a full life by 40 is an incredible dream and goal and it does not sound crazy at all to me to desire this. In 20 years I wish to have traveled all over the world. I think traveling is one of the main ways to acquire knowledge. Just being in another environment, climate and social context gives you invaluable information and experience, to be well traveled is very difficult right now because of all of the economic and practical limitations but in 20 years I hope to have had the liberty to take myself into the wilderness of the world, to eat every weird food, to see and pet every weird animal, to try and fail miserably to speak any mysterious language. In 20 years I hope that I will say that I have met a lot of wonderful people. It is really hard to believe but behind every person that is in the crowd, that crowd that takes individuality away, there is someone with hopes dreams and interesting thoughts and opinions, I wish to meet all of them or at least a good part. I wish to be a man that is not fooled by appearances and that is wise enough to listen and to observe. But most of all in 20 years I wish to be happy. Now, talking about happiness is a sensible subject because everyone has very strong opinions about this word, truly, I do not know what being happy is or means, I just believe that when that feeling comes I will know immediately.
